# Data Kaizen

Welcome to my digital garden. My name is Ahmed, and I'm a Software Engineer with humble expertise in Machine Learning and Data Engineering. This is my personal wiki where I document my knowledge and share it with the world. I built this digital garden to learn how to write. 

I will try and add content here at least once a week, if not more. My goal is to make my writing here better bit by bit. I will also do my best to make my content as simple as I can. The content here is not perfect, but I try my best to make it as accurate as possible, please do accept my sincere apologies if my content is lacking in any sense, and feel free to suggest fixes.
