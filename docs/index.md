# Data Kaizen

Step into my digital garden. My name is Ahmed and I am a Software Engineer specialising in Machine Learning and Data Engineering. This is my personal wiki, where I plan to document my knowledge and experience to share it with the world.

I would like to utilise this platform as a learning ground for enriching my writing skills. Expect weekly updates as I aim to make steady step-by-step improvements. While my work is not flawless, I will do my best to provide content as accurate as possible. Feel free to make suggestions on quality improvement or content recommendations. Thank you for joining me on this journey!
